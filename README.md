"# Project-2-Banking-Application" 

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.: 
A simple interest calculation program that outputs the amount of interest earned based on the number of years, interest rate, and initial deposit input. 

What did you do particularly well?: 
Program displays correct balances accounting taking into account amounts less than one cent. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?: The code could be improved by formatting the final display output to line up evenly.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write? How did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?: Implementing the format for the change was a struggle at first but I was able to figure it out with trial and error. I found using YouTube examples of functions was a great resource to use when I was confused.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?: 
I find that using objects and classes is an extremely useful skill that concepts can be applied to other OOP coding languages. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?:
To make this program maintainable I used a class to create objects. This enables me to make quicker changes to the class's members rather than having to rewrite the code each time there needs to be a change. This also organizes the code so it is much easier to read.
